EXERCISE 1 

	a) /(a[ab]*)*c*
	b) /^(?:[^a]*a){5}([bc]*)$
	c) (1)00(0)*
	d) ^(?:111[01][01]1|1[01]11[01]1|1[01]1[01]11|101001([01]+))  // one of the nicest questions
	e) ^(?![abc]*baa)[abc]*$
	f) ^(?:0[A-F0-9]*|[0-9]*)
	g) a^n + b^n = (a+b)^n --> solve by summing using binomial (out of scope)

EXERCISE 2 
	a) This requires conditional computation, since the number of As allowed changes based on the number of Bs in the input text
	b) This requires conditional computation, since the second half of the text must match the string reverse of the first half of the input text
	c) The ML (Meta Language) family of programming languages, which includes Standard ML (SML) and OCaml, is not a regular language according to formal language theory. 

EXERCISE 3
	a) All 4 digits binary numbers except 0110
	b) the regular expression => a[aaaa]*
	c) A binary number that has every 0 outside of the parenthesis 10 01 and every 1 inside
